Subject: Fix path to qemu-dm

When creating a configuration we can completely leave out the path
to qemu-dm and the Xen tools will extend it to the default path.
Though that means that the testing is also broken and I am not sure
how that could be fixed. The output of configuration would always be
different and also different between Xen releases as those binaries
are in per-release version paths. Up to a certain point alternates
where used but that is gone.
