virt-manager (1:1.0.1-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Merge from debian experimental. (LP: #1213337)
  * Merged changes from Ubuntu virt-manager package:
    - Updated to 1.0.1 release
    - debian/control: Depend on gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 for appindicator
      support.
    - debian/control: Add lsb-release to BuildDepends so we can detect
      whether we're running on Ubuntu or Debian.
    - debian/rules: Set qemu user to libvirt-qemu so appropriate
      permissions get set.
    - debian/rules: Set the preferred distro so we appear first in the
      list.
    - debian/patches/more_helpful_error_message.patch: explain to the user
      why connecting to qemu:///system failed and how to fix it.
    - debian/patches/use_ubuntu_package_names.patch: Suggest installing the
      packages that are actually available in Ubuntu.
    - debian/patches/uefi_support.patch: ugly hack to add a UEFI firmware
      option.
  * Merged changes from Ubuntu virtinst package:
    - debian/patches/virtinst/9004_ubuntu_fix_tree_support.patch: Fix tree
      detection for all ISO/HTTP source, to not longer fail with
      cobbler/koan.
    - debian/patches/virtinst/9005_ubuntu_releases.patch: add Trusty,
      updated support status, and switch back to cirrus by default to get a
      reasonable screen size during installation.
    - debian/patches/virtinst/9006_fix_path_to_qemu-dm.patch: drop the full
      path from qemu-dm as already done for hvmloader and pygrub. The Xen
      tools will handle this and add the missing path.
  * debian/patches/add_qemu_binaries.patch: add the actual binary names
    from the qemu packages so default hypervisor detection works properly
    on first run.
  * debian/patches/fix_changing_graphics_type.patch: fix changing the
    graphics type in the details dialog.
  * debian/patches/hook_into_domain_balloon_event.patch: properly hook into
    hotplug events so memory size gets updated.
  * debian/patches/fix_showing_vcpus.patch: display the right number of
    vcpus in the customize dialog.

virt-manager (0.9.0-3ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Merge from debian unstable. Remaining changes:
    - debian/control, debian/rules: Build using dh_python2
    - debian/control: Depend on python-appindicator for appindicator
      support.
    - Add a /usr/share/pixmaps/virt-manager-icon.svg symlink to link icon to
      where the Application Indicator can find it.
    - debian/patches/more_helpful_error_message.patch: explain to the user
      why he can't connect to qemu:///system and what he can do fix it.
    - debian/control: lower libvirt-bin from Recommends to Suggests; seems
      some users (like netbooks) want to manage VMs, but not host them; see
      meta packages (ubuntu-virt, ubuntu-virt-server, ubuntu-virt-mgmt) for
      group installation of virt package sets.
    - debian/patches/use_ubuntu_package_names.patch: Suggest installing the
      packages that are actually available in Ubuntu.
    - debian/patches/fix-remote-vnc-reconnect.patch: Force ssh tunnels to
      close when closing a Viewer window, so that reconnections will work.
    - debian/patches/fix_grep_portability.patch: support target systems
      where the grep utility has no -q option.
    - debian/patches/fix_net_stats.patch: fix broken net stats gathering.
    - debian/rules: Set qemu user to libvirt-qemu so appropriate
      permissions get set.
    - debian/rules: Set Ubuntu as the preferred distro so we appear first
      in the list.
    - debian/rules: disable TUI for now, since the required dependencies
      are not available (Newt Syrup).
    - debian/rules: Drop patchsys-quilt include since dpkg-source does the
      quilt dance for us.
    - Removed python-ipy dependency as it is in universe:
      - debian/control: remove python-ipy from Depends
      - debian/series: disable 0002-Use-IPy-from-python-ipy.patch patch so
        we use the one that's included in the virt-manager source.
      - debian/rules: don't delete the IPy file.
  * Removed patches:
    - debian/patches/fix_resize_to_vm.patch: has equivalent Debian patch.
  * debian/control: drop python-spice-client-gtk to Suggests as it is in
    universe.
